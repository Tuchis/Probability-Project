## Simple tool for solving simple combinatorics cases such as different forms of permutations, allocations or combinations.

## Some examples of questions to clasify the problem
### If you want to place / mix all the objects, you should go for Permutations.

Are all objects distinguishable? Yes - P, No - M

### If youâ€™d like to arrange some of them into specific places, go for Allocations.

Can chosen places repeat? Yes - $n^k$, No - $A^n_k$

### If you wish to choose a group out of all objects / divide them into groups, go for Combinations.

Want to divide them into groups?
   Yes -  $C^{n+k-1}_{k-1}$
   No - $C^n_k$
